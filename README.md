Sandra.Snow.BarbatoTemplate
===========================

This is an empty repository that you can fork and put your blog posts in.  When you use Sandra.Snow.Barbato you give it the address of your forked repository and it will use it to convert your Markdown files into HTML and then publish to your cloud host or FTP server. It will then push back the changes to your forked repository so you have the HTML files as well!
